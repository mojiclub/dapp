               <h4 class="title">11. Release</h4>
               <p>IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF A JURISDICTION THAT REQUIRES A SPECIFIC STATEMENT REGARDING RELEASE THEN THE FOLLOWING APPLIES.&nbsp; FOR EXAMPLE, CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS MUST, AS A CONDITION OF THIS AGREEMENT, WAIVE THE APPLICABILITY OF CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542, WHICH STATES, “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."&nbsp; YOU HEREBY WAIVE THIS SECTION OF THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE.&nbsp; YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY SIMILAR PROVISION IN LAW, REGULATION, OR CODE THAT HAS THE SAME INTENT OR EFFECT AS THE AFOREMENTIONED RELEASE.&nbsp; YOU RELEASE US FROM ANY LIABILITY RELATING TO OUR SITE OR MJF CONTENT, AND YOU RELEASE US, OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, AND AGENTS FROM ANY CLAIMS AND DAMAGES, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH ANY CLAIM YOU HAVE AGAINST US. THIS RELEASE DOES NOT APPLY TO NEW JERSEY USERS.</p>
               <p>If you are a resident of a jurisdiction that requires a specific statement regarding release, then the following applies. For example, California residents must, as a condition of this Agreement, waive the applicability of California Civil Code Section 1542 which states, “a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.” You hereby waive this section of the California Civil Code. You hereby waive any similar provision in law, regulation, or code that has the same intent or effect as the aforementioned release. You release us from any liability relating to our site or MJF Content, and you release us, our directors, officers, employees, affiliates, and agents from any claims and damages, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any claim you have against us. This release does not apply to New Jersey users.</p>
               <h4 class="title">12. Digital Millenium Copyright Act of 1988</h4>
               <p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under the U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by MJF infringe your copyright, you, or your agent may send to MJF a notice requesting that the material be removed or access to it be blocked. Any notification by a copyright owner or a person authorized to act on its behalf that fails to comply with requirements of the DMCA shall not be considered sufficient notice and shall not be deemed to confer upon MJF actual knowledge of facts or circumstances from which infringing material or acts are evident. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send to MJF a counter-notice. All notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright for details. MJF’s Copyright Agent for notice of claims of copyright infringement or counter notices can be reached as follows: through a direct message to MJF’s Twitter at @RNDMCHARACTERS.</p>
