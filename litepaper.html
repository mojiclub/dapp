                        <h3>PHASE 1 : DEMOCRATIZING THE PROJECT</h3>
                        <p>
                            Everyone needs to hear about The Moji Club. During this phase, we will announce the project, and we will distribute whitelists and free mints with the help of giveaways and small tasks. We will make sure that every engaged fan will be able to get a whitelist. During these few weeks, we will run votes, we will settle the last elements concerning the project, and we will post teasers on social media.
                        </p>

                        <p class="roadmap_num">2</p>
                        <h3>PHASE 2 : ALPHA VERSION</h3>
                        <p>
                            Our team has been working on the Moji Club since the beginning of 2022, working on the tech enabling the decentralization of a complete social network.<br>
                            The Alpha version will be a sandbox/read-only version of the Moji Club social network, where you will be able to preview our vision regarding the project. You will not be able to like, share, or comment posts during the Alpha phase. We will announce the Alpha launch on <a target="_blank" class="twitter_link underline" href="">Twitter</a> and <a target="_blank" class="discord_link underline" href="">Discord</a>.
                        </p>

                        <h3>PHASE 3 : PFPs AND BETA LAUNCH</h3>
                        <p>
                            Our number one priority is to deliver a smooth listing and Beta version. Once we are satisfied with the renderings and with the Beta infrastructure, we will announce the launch date on <a target="_blank" class="twitter_link underline" href="">Twitter</a> and <a target="_blank" class="discord_link underline" href="">Discord</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Beta version of The Moji Club will be enabled a few hours before PFP listing. The Beta version will only be accessible to PFP holders and their friends, so once you get your PFP, you will be instantly able to create your profile, start using the network, and invite your friends!
                        </p>

                        <h3>PHASE 4 : GEN1 LAUNCH</h3>
                        <p>
                            As soon as the GEN0 PFPs solds out, GEN1 gets enabled. GEN0 holders will be able to immediately <a href="/claim.html" class="underline">claim</a> their first $MJCC for free.<br>
                            $MJCC can then be listed on the secondary market and/or used to mint GEN1 PFPs for free!

                        <h3>PHASE 5 : SOCIAL NETWORK - PUBLIC LAUNCH</h3>
                        <p>
                            <i>Estimated release date : Fall 2022</i><br>
                            Building a sustainable protocol, creating the network blockchain, validators daemons, and prepare for the economic incentives will take time and a lot of tests.<br>
                            The social network finally goes live, with incentives for new users and a growth focused approach from our team, to quickly reach the critical mass of users necessary to sustain a good social network.

                <p>The Moji Club is a <b>decentralized, open source</b> social network, <b>without censorship</b>, and with <b>a fair, deactivatable and non-targeting advertising system.</b></p>
                <p><b>Accessing your profile</b> on The Moji Club is done through your <b>Ethereum wallet</b>, and your profile picture has to be defined according to one of your NFTs. <b>The Moji Club will NEVER require your phone number, email, or any other information infringing on your privacy.</b></p>
                <p>
                    <b>A Beta version is planned</b>, with access restricted to holders and their friends (invite code system).<br>
                    During the Beta, only the Moji Club PFPs will be usable as profile picture, while this will be expanded to other NFTs in the public version.
                </p>
                <sep class="sep32"></sep>
                <p>The Moji Club features a familiar of <b>posting, sharing, liking and commenting</b>, with<b> keys features</b> :</p>
                <p>
                    - A completely <b>open source code</b><br>
                    - A <b>fair</b>, <b>deactivatable</b> and <b>non-targeting advertising system</b><br>
                    - A social network at your service, <b>not there to capture your attention and sell you the latest trendy gadget</b><br>
                    - <b>Feeds</b> : A fully customizable set of lists of accounts you follow, that can be <b>organized on categories, interests</b>, and so on. <b>You cannot imagine how much Feeds will be life saving to organize things you want to read everyday!</b><br>
                    - <b>No collection of data, no shady AI</b><br>
                    - <b>Strong governance</b> voting for <b>advertisements approvals</b> and <b>new features</b> (governance requires holding one Moji Club PFP)
                <p>
                <sep class="sep32"></sep>
                <p>
                    <b>Ads have to be reviewed and approved by the governance</b> (minimum 95% approval). <b>Holders</b> who vote for the approval (or to decline) for an ad <b>receive 40% of the advertising revenue.</b> However, since users of the network can completely disable advertising, <b>it is in the interest of the governance to approve quality ads to keep the advertising revenues interesting and avoid that a lot of users disable ads.</b><br>
                    However, new accounts are not be able to disable advertising for 7 days, in order avoid systematic deactivation linked to poor quality ads experience from social networks such as Facebook and others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The network runs on <b>blockchain technology</b>, and validators have to stack a Moji Club PFP. <b>Validators share 40% of the advertising revenues.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The remaining 20% of the advertising revenues will be held in reserve by the protocol to finance governance decisions on incentives and growth.

                    <h2>THE NEW NFT TECH</h2>
                    <sep></sep>
                </div>
                <p>The Moji Club PFPs system is the very first to allow <b>complete token personnalization</b>, thanks to <b>a unique custom mint system.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                   Create your very own PFP using The Configuratooor, from <b>hundreds of customization traits</b>, and get <b>the certification</b> that your PFP belongs to you and you alone thanks to the <b>Ethereum blockchain</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All NFTs collections you know are based on a Mint → Reveal system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Moji Club PFPs works differently</b>, generating each NFT directly during the Mint process. Since the blockchain data is public, <b>the traits scarcity is managed off-chain in a remote server containing an Ethereum private key</b>. (Learn more reading <a class="underline" href="/provable-fairness.html">Provable fairness</a>)
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the PFPs traits are available, the server uploads the NFT on the IPFS and returns a cryptographic proof that is verified on-chain. This prevents cheaters from consciously selecting the rarest traits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The unicity of each PFP is <b>guaranteed by the Ethereum blockchain.</b> Once your PFP is set up and minted, a representation of its traits is permanently stored in the blockchain.

                    We plan to release the Moji Club social network in <b>three phases</b> : The <b>Alpha</b> version, the <b>Beta</b> version, and the <b>Public</b> version.
                </p>
                <h4 class="title">THE ALPHA VERSION</h4>
                <p>
                    <b>The Alpha version</b> will be the first phase of the three. It consists of a sandbox/read-only version of the Moji Club social network, where you will be able to preview our vision regarding the project. You will not be able to like, share, or comment posts during the Alpha phase as it is read only, but you will be able to get an idea on how it will look, and what the features are like.
                </p>
                <h4 class="title">THE BETA VERSION</h4>
                <p>
                    <b>The Beta version</b> will be the second phase of the three. It will consist of a much more polished version, running on a testnet. It will allow users to log-in using a non-custodian Ethereum wallet. The Beta version is a read/write version and will support commenting, liking, sharing posts, creating Feeds, following other users and much more. The Beta version will continuously evolve with new features and bug fixes. During this phase, we strongly encourage users to invite new friends to the platform to grow the community. 
                </p>
                <h4 class="title">THE PUBLIC VERSION</h4>
                <p>
                    <b>The Public version</b> will be the last phase. The Public version will be run on its own blockchain, maintained and secured by PFP holders who choose to do so. Once the Public version will be released, we will build an Ads manager for advertisers, gradually enable the governance and automate it to keep as little power as possible. Once the public version is up and running, we will keep maintaining it based on the governance decisions.
